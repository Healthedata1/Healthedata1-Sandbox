description: >-
   This profile sets minimum expectations for the Specimen resource to record, search, and fetch "substances being sampled or tested. (e.g., nasopharyngeal swab, whole blood, serum, urine, wound swab)" associated with a patient to promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation.  It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile.  It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.
