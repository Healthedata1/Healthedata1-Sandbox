        Some questions on questionnaires are not answered directly (e.g.,
        asserted) by the individual completing the questionnaire, but are
        derived from answers to one or more other questions. For types of
        answers, `Observation.performer` should not be specified and
        `Observation.derivedFrom` should reference the relevant Screening
        Response Observation(s).

        An observation may have; 1)  a single value here, 2)  both a value and a
        set of related or component values,  or 3)  only a set of related or
        component values. If a value is present, the datatype for this element
        should be determined by Observation.code.  A CodeableConcept with just a
        text would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded,
        or if the type associated with the Observation.code defines a coded
        value.

      comment: >-
        "Null" or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR
        Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and
        represent the exceptions in the value.  The alternate way is to use the
        value element for actual observations and use the explicit
        dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values. For a given LOINC
        question, if the LOINC answer list includes concepts such as 'unknown'
        or 'not available', they should be used for Observation.value. Where
        these concepts are not part of the value set for Observation.value, the
        Observation.dataAbsentReason can be used if necessary and appropriate.

    #   comment: >-
    #      This grouping element is used to represent surveys that group several questions together. For example in the simplest case a flat multi-question survey where the "panel" observation is the survey instrument  itself and instead of an `Observation.value` the `hasMember` element references other Observation that represent the individual questions answer pairs. In a survey that has a heirarchical grouping of questions, the observation "panels" can be nested. Because surveys can be arbitrarily complex structurally, not all survey structures can be represented using this Observation grouping pattern.
