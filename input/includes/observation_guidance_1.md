* Additional codes that translate or map to the Observation code or category codes are allowed.  For example:
   -  providing both a local code and LOINC code
   -  providing a more specific code {{include.example1}}, a [SNOMED CT] concept, or a system specific code.
* Systems **SHOULD** support `Observation.effectivePeriod` to accurately represent procedure tests that are collected over a period of time {{include.example2}}.

* See the [General Guidance Section] for further guidance on using SNOMED and UCUM.
* See the [LOINC scale type to FHIR data type mapping] for guidance on which `Observation.value[x]` data type to use based on the LOINC Type of Scale.
