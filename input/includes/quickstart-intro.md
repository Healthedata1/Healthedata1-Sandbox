Below is an overview of the required Server RESTful FHIR interactions for this profile - for example, search and read operations - when supporting the US Core interactions to access this profileâ€™s information (Profile Support + Interaction Support). Note that systems that support only US Core Profiles (Profile Only Support) are not required to support these interactions.  See the [US Core Server CapabilityStatement] for a complete list of supported RESTful interactions for this IG.

- The syntax used to describe the interactions is described [here](general-guidance.html#search-syntax).
- See the [General Requirements] section for additional rules and expectations when a server requires status parameters.
- See the [General Guidance] section for additional guidance on searching for multiple patients.
