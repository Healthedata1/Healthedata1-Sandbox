    "description": "The US Core Simple Observation Profile meets the requirements of the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Assessments. To promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation, the US Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile sets the minimum expectations for the Observation Resource to record, search, and fetch observations representing the questions and responses to surveys and screening and assessment tools. For example, a social history status such as education or food insecurity or an assessment of the patient's cognitive, functional, or disability status. It can represent a single response, multiple responses, and multi-select \"check all that apply\" type questions. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.",

For a given LOINC question, if the LOINC answer list includes concepts such as 'unknown' or 'not available', they should be used for Observation.value. Where these concepts are not part of the value set for Observation.value, the Observation.dataAbsentReason can be used if necessary and appropriate.",
