    description: The US Core Simple Observation Profile meets the requirements of
      the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Assessments. To promote interoperability
      and adoption through common implementation, the US Core Observation Screening
      Assessment Profile sets the minimum expectations for the Observation Resource
      to record, search, and fetch observations representing the questions and responses
      to surveys and screening and assessment tools. For example, a social history
      status such as education or food insecurity or an assessment of the patient's
      cognitive, functional, or disability status. It can represent a single response,
      multiple responses, and multi-select "check all that apply" type questions.
      It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets
      **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. It provides the
      floor for standards development for specific use cases.

    description: This profile sets minimum expectations for the Provenance resource
      to record, search, and fetch Provenance information associated with a record
      to promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation.  It
      identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL**
      be present in the resource when using this profile.  This FHIR Provenance profile
      here covers the minimal (basic) information to support lineage of information.  It
      provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.  Prior
      to reviewing this profile, implementers are encouraged to read the Basic Provenance
      guidance page which documents several key use cases, specifically, what organization
      was responsible for the most recent action on the resource.
