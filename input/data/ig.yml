    description: A Capability Statement documents a set of capabilities (behaviors)
      of a FHIR Server for a particular version of FHIR that may be used as a statement
      of actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server
      implementation.

      reference: StructureDefinition/capabilitystatement-recognized-profile
    description: This extension identifies a profile the system will recognize if
      it is declared in [`meta.profile`](resource.html#profile-tags). If the system
      supports the [`_profile`](search.html#profile) search parameter, it will be
      capable of searching on the profile. The system may support validation against
      the profile.

      reference: StructureDefinition/capabilitystatement-search-parameter-combination
    description: 'This extension defines a possible search parameter combination by
      listing a set of search parameters and indicating whether they are required
      or optional.

      - If a search combination is specified, clients should expect that they must
      submit a search that meets one of the required combinations or the search will
      be unsuccessful.

      - If multiple search parameter combinations are specified, a client may pick
      between them, and supply the minimal required parameters for any of the combinations.

      - If no parameters in the set of search parameters are listed as required, then
      *at least one* of the listed optional parameters must be present.  This shorthand
      method is the same as repeating the entire extension for each combination of
      optional and required search parameters.'

  - reference:
      reference: StructureDefinition/argo-write-observation
    description: Defines a "mixin" profile which constrains and extends the Observation
      resource for the minimal set of data to support to writing patient submitted
      Observations to an EHR.  This profile is intended to be used in addition to
      other Observation Profiles such as the [US Core Body Weight Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-body-weight.html).
      When an application is creating content, it must create content that conforms
      to both sets of profiles - that is, the intersection of the profiles. When an
      application is consuming information, then it must be able to consume content
      that conforms to either set of profiles - that is, the union of the profiles.
      For additional guidance see [Supporting Multiple Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html#mixing)
      in the FHIR specification.

      (USCDI) v2 ''Problems'' and ''Health Concerns'' requirements and SDOH ''Problems/Health
      Concerns'' requirements.  It defines constraints and extensions on the Condition
      resource for the minimal set of data to record, search, and fetch information
      about a condition, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical
