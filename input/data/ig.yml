            resource for the minimal set of data to support to writing patient submitted
            Observations to an EHR.  This profile is intended to be used in addition
            to other Observation Profiles such as the [US Core Body Weight Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-body-weight.html).
            When an application is creating content, it must create content that conforms
            to both sets of profiles - that is, the intersection of the profiles.
            When an application is consuming information, then it must be able to
            consume content that conforms to either set of profiles - that is, the
            union of the profiles. For additional guidance see [Supporting Multiple
            Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html#mixing) in the FHIR specification.
